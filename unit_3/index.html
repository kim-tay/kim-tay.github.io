	<p>"The difference between an ordinary life and an extraordinary one is only a matter of perspective. Pull the blinds. Look around you. It is a weird, wonderful world and you do not require a ten digit bank account to immerse yourself in it. Travel down dusty roads without a destination in mind. Climb a mountain and scream out into the void. Kiss a stranger. Skinny dip in a lake. Get lost and lose yourself (these are two separate things). Explore the wilderness (particularly the one within). Think less of destiny and more of the moment right here. Because in the end, as you reflect back on your life in that hospital bed, surrounded by all of your family and friends, fame won't matter, nor will the extent of your wealth - you are only the sum of the stories you can tell."
